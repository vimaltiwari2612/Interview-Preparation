/*You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone in the party. Your task is to find the stranger (celebrity) in party.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{0 1 0},
         {0 0 0}, 
         {0 1 0}}
Output: 1
Explanation: The matrix will look like
0 1 0 
0 0 0
0 1 0
Here,  the celebrity is the person with
index 1 ie id 1 
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
M[][] = {{0 1},
         {1 0}}
Output: -1
Explanation: The matrix will look like
0 1
1 0
Here, there is no such person who is a
celebrity (a celebrity should know no
one).
Your Task:
You will be given a square matrix M[][] where if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to complete the function getId() which finds the id of the celebrity if present else return -1. The function getId() takes two arguments, the square matrix M and its size N.

Note: 
M[i][i] will be equal to zero always.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 501
0 <= M[][] <= 1

        int b = n-1;
        
        while(a<b){
            if(M[a][b] == 1){
                a++;
            }
            else {
                b--;
            }
        }
        //now here a == b, after while
        
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            //check if not same person AND ( A knows I OR I doesn't know A) return -1
            if(i != a && (M[i][a] == 0 || M[a][i] == 1)) return -1;
        }
        
        return a;
    }
